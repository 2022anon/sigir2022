We release the data and codes used in our paper.
# Data
We uploaded the core codes in File "data":  
```
File "yelp" contains the synthetic semi-structured training pairs and generated summaries.	  
File "amazon" contains the synthetic semi-structured training pairs and generated summaries.
File "rt" contains the synthetic semi-structured training pairs and generated summaries.
```

# Codes
We uploaded the core codes of synthetic data creation and proposed models in File "code". The details are described in `code/README.md`.
Both basic model and advanced model are implemented based on [Fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq) framework provided.
